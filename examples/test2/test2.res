 2                    she didn't know where she was. Having one's own
 4                         sure for a while she had failed in her
 5                      with Rico. And then she had had something really
 6                        had worked out as she wanted. Rico had come
 8                       her. And now, when she was twenty-five and he
 8                  she was twenty-five and he was three months older
 8                   was three months older,they were a charming married
 9               a charming married couple. He flirted with other women
 10                       still,to be sure. He wouldn't be the handsome
 10                    the handsome Rico if he didn't. But she had
 11                       if he didn't. But she had 'got' him. Oh
 13                  to know how completely he was mastered. She,with
 15             completely he was mastered. She,with her odd little
 21                  charm and her failure. She didn't quite belong.    Of
 22              quite belong.    Of course she was American: Louisiana family
 23                      down to Texas. And she was moderately rich,with
 24                  except her mother. But she had been sent to
 25                   school in France when she was twelve,and since
 25                    was twelve,and since she had finished school,she
 25                 she had finished school,she had drifted from Paris
 29                    sort of American was she,after all?    And what
 30                    sort of European was she either? She didn't 'belong'
 30                European was she either? She didn't 'belong' anywhere. 
 33                          It was in Rome she had met Rico. He
 33                       she had met Rico. He was an Australian,son

 36                 the only son. Meanwhile he floated round Europe on
 39                 was being an artist.    They met in Rome when
 39                        met in Rome when they were twenty-two,and had
 41             handsome,elegant,but mostly he had spots of paint
 41                     on his trousers and he ruined a necktie pulling
 42                 necktie pulling it off. He behaved in a most
 43                        at the same time he was canny and shrewd
 45      on principle good-hearted,anxious. He was anxious for his
 46                      place in the world,he was poor,and suddenly
 52      suave,courtier-like amiability.    He was fascinated by Lou's
 56                    was so American. Yet she used no Americanisms at
 57                      at all,except when she lapsed into her odd
 58                     of acid irony, when she was very American indeed
 59            very American indeed!    And she was fascinated by Rico
 59                 was fascinated by Rico. They played to each other
 60              butterflies at one flower. They pretended to be very
 61                          poor in Rome - he was poor: and very
 62                        out at them. And they had that love affair
 64                 affair in Capri.    But they reacted badly on each
 64                 on each other's nerves. She became ill. Her mother
 65               ill. Her mother appeared. He couldn't stand Mrs Witt
 68                 Nothing would stop him. He must go back to
 70                go back to Australia.    He went to Melbourne,and
 73                   strange lands to her. She came away disheartened,panting
 75                     to meet Rico again. They couldn't get away from
 76        rather restrained correspondence he informed her that he

 85                of the show. 'Certainly',she said,'when these people

 87                    they've got no money,they fall in love with
