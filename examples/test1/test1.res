 1             The University ; "A society of individuals living and working 
 2       together for the advancement of learning and the dissemination of 
 3       knowledge".  (University of York Development Plan).      
 4       In 1617 James I received a petition requesting a University 
 5       for York.  This was followed by a petition to Parliament in 1652, 
 6       and a deputation to the University Grants Committee in 1947.  The 
 7       University officially opened in 1963 with a student population 
 8       comprising 216 undergraduates and 12 postgraduates.      
 9       The site consisted of 190 acres of marshy land and a large 
 10      decrepit Elizabethan mansion, Heslington Hall, destined to become 
 11      the administration building.  Draining the saturated ground was 
 12      accomplished by widening a natural stream and creating a fourteen 
 13      acre artificial lake around which the University was constructed.
