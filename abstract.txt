CLOC is a program which allows one to examine natural language text. It
currently includes the production of sorted vocabulary lists, word indexes,
concordances, automatic discovery of collocations, and searches for phrases.
It has been designed for ease of use by people with little or no computer
experience, and has been used by Humanities students both for teaching
and research.
